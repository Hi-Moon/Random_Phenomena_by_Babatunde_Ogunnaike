# Random_Phenomena_by_Babatunde_Ogunnaike

This repository contains solutions to the problem exercises from the book ["Random Phenomena: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics for Engineers"](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Phenomena-Fundamentals-Probability-Statistics/dp/1420044974/ref=pd_sbs_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1420044974&pd_rd_r=9KB0JV1BCNX8S18B6SWD&pd_rd_w=hypGN&pd_rd_wg=6CsGZ&psc=1&refRID=9KB0JV1BCNX8S18B6SWD) by Babatunde Ogunnaike.

This book provides all the required knowledge about randomly varying phenomena, how to generalize them using statistical methods, introduces to various statistical distributions and extends the concepts to the basic mathematics behind modern Machine Learning models.

The solutions are written in Tex. I have tried to include Python codes to the problems wherever required/possible. 

Suggestions for better approaches or solutions to currently unsolved problems are welcomed.
